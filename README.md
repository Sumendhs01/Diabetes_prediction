Diabetic prediction is the use of machine learning or artificial intelligence to predict the likelihood of someone developing diabetes. This can be done by analyzing a person's medical history, lifestyle factors, and genetic data.

Diabetic prediction has the potential to improve the prevention and treatment of diabetes. Early detection of diabetes can help to prevent or delay the onset of complications. Diabetic prediction can also help people to make lifestyle changes to reduce their risk of developing diabetes, and it can help healthcare providers to identify people who need early treatment.
